**Hello!** 

- - -

I started creating this blog in October of 2019. I've always been opinionated and I decided I wanted to share what I was thinking with others. Online, of course. I decided to start a website and now here I am, sitting behind my fathers old laptop that barely works and typing up a paragraph about myself that may never even be read by anyone else. Crazy, really, but that's it.
